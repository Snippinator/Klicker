=======

This project is still under construction.

Functions
=========

This app should be able to save activities with a definition, 
a duration and maybe a number of subunits if they consist of 
more than one.

After creating an activity, it will be saved inside the DB.
All activities are listed in a LinearLayout. Each time an
activity will be started, the user can increment the activity
by clicking the activitys' button.

Even a List or if possible, a graph should be available,
to get an overview about the accomplished activities.

Furthermore, after finishing the apps main features there
should be implemented some kind of reminder function. 
This function should recognize how often a user increments
an activity and based on this calculate the next date on
which he/she should get a reminder. A thinkable solution 
would also be, to connect this reminder with the google 
calendar and create a date.

Benefit
=======

It should be some kind of helper, to let you know how often
you do specific activities and even remember you to do
the one you didn't increment so that the user can achieve
continuity in each activities she/he must accomplish.
